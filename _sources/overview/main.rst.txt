Main configuration file
==============================
The main configuration file is used to define the global settings, notably the paths to the different sources of data. The parameters of the main configuration file are described in Table 2.

   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 10 70

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Description
   * - name
     - STRING
     - Name of the data processing. This name is used in the path of the saved products in the following manner:

       ``<saveimgbasepath>/<name>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<datasetname>/<prodname>/<outputname>``
   * - datapath
     - STRING
     - Base directory of the rainbow raw data. This field must have a trailing '/'. The raw data files of a scan can be found using the following file path:

       ``<datapath>/<scanname>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS00datatype>.<ext>``
   * - configpath
     - STRING
     - Absolute base directory of the configuration files. This directory contains clutter maps, filter coefficients, antenna pattern, and the data processing configuration files. If any path within a pyrad config file is provided as a relative path, it will be converted to an absolute path, by prepending it with the path specified with "configpath". If not provided, the directory of the main config file will be used.
   * - locationConfigFile
     - STRING
     - File nameof the location configuration file. If only the filename (and not directory) is provided it will be prepended with configpath. Described in Section 3.2.
   * - productConfigFile
     - STRING
     - File name of the product configuration file.  If only the filename (and not directory) is provided it will be prepended with configpath. Described in Section 4.
   * - lastStateFile
     - STRING
     - File name (with full path) of the file containing the time of the last processed scan. Used in particular for real-time processing.
   * - imgformat
     - STRING
       STRARR
     - File format(s) of the images. The following formats are supported: eps, png, and jpg. If ``saveimg`` is set to 0, this field is not used.
   * - saveimgbasepath
     - STRING
     - Base directory for the images to save. The directory structure looks as follows:

       ``<saveimgbasepath>/<name>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<datasetname>/<prodname>/<outputname>``

       If ``saveimg`` is set to 0, this field is not used.
   * - s3EndpointRead
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Url to an S3 endpoint containing input radar data. The format must be https://endpoint.domain (e.g. https://eu-central-1.linodeobjects.com/), the https:// is not mandatory.
   * - s3BucketRead
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Name of an S3 bucket containing input radar data. It has to be used together with ``s3EndpointRead`` and ``s3PathRead`` to be able to read input radar data from a bucket. The procedure will only work by setting the environment variables S3_KEY_READ and S3_SECRET_READ.
   * - s3PathRead
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Path where to find input radar data in an S3 bucket. The data will be retrieved at url https://s3BucketRead.s3EndpointRead/s3PathRead/*
   * - rm_s3_file
     - INT
     - OPTIONAL. If set, input radar data files downloaded from an S3 bucket will be removed after reading.
   * - s3EndpointWrite
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Url to an S3 endpoint where to store output data. The format must be https://endpoint.domain (e.g. https://eu-central-1.linodeobjects.com/), the https:// is not mandatory.
   * - s3BucketWrite
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Name of an S3 bucket for output radar data. It has to be used together with ``s3EndpointWrite`` and ``s3PathWrite`` to save output data to a bucket. Requires S3_KEY_WRITE and S3_SECRET_WRITE environment variables.
   * - s3PathWrite
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Path where to save output radar data in an S3 bucket. The data will be saved at url https://s3BucketRead.s3EndpointRead/s3PathRead/filename
   * - s3SplitExtensionWrite
     - INT
     - OPTIONAL. If set to 1, files with multiple extensions are stored separately in the S3 bucket. For example, myfolder/out.csv becomes myfolder/csv/out.csv. Default is 0 (False).
   * - s3Verify
     - INT
     - OPTIONAL. If set to 0, disables SSL verification for S3 operations. Default is 1.
   * - s3Certificates
     - INT
     - OPTIONAL. Path to SSL certificates, only needed if custom certificates are used.
   * - loadbasepath
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Base path of saved data. Defaults to ``saveimgbasepath``.
   * - loadname
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Name of the saved data processing. Used for saved volume loading. Defaults to ``name``.
   * - gecsxbasepath
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Base path of saved visibility fields generated by the GECSX tool.
   * - gecsxname
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Name of the GECSX dataset containing the visibility fields. Used for GECSX volume loading.
   * - dempath
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Base directory of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) files. Used to load radar visibility.
   * - smnpath
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Base directory of SwissMetNet stations data. Used for comparison with rain gauges.
   * - disdropath
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Base directory of disdrometer data. Used for comparison with disdrometers.
   * - solarfluxpath
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Base directory of solar flux data. Used to plot calibration bias from sun monitoring.
   * - iconpath
     - STRING
     - OPTIONAL. Base directory of ICON (NWP model) data files.
