Pending modifications for current code in Pyrad
-----------------------------------------------
- In function process_echo_id: Add condition on differential reflectivity at low reflectivity values. Allow user to select the various thresholds. Add a speckle filter
- In function process_echo_filter: Enable the user to select what to keep and what to filter out.
- In functions to obtain cross-sections: check whether the angles are close enough (within a tolerance) to the specified angle where to do the cross-check

Processing functions to be implemented with highest priority:
-------------------------------------------------------------
- KDP processing
- Melting layer estimator

Product functions to be implemented with highest priority:
----------------------------------------------------------
- CAPPI plots
