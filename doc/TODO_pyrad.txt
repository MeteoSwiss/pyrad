Pending modifications for current code in Pyrad
-----------------------------------------------
- In function process_echo_id: Add condition on differential reflectivity at low reflectivity values. Allow user to select the various thresholds. Add a speckle filter
- In function process_echo_filter: Enable the user to select what to keep and what to filter out.
- In selfconsistency functions: get tables as a function of elevation, allow user to define the tresholds
- In function to get the freezing level mask: find the way to account for the antenna beamwidth when considering up to which altitude there is valid data
- Put functions in different files.
- In process sun hits, find a way to get the file name where sun hits are stored
