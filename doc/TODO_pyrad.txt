Pending modifications for current code in Pyrad
-----------------------------------------------
- In function process_echo_id: Add condition on differential reflectivity at low reflectivity values. Allow user to select the various thresholds. Add a speckle filter
- In selfconsistency functions: get tables as a function of elevation, allow user to define the tresholds
- In the sun check read the solar hits.

Documentation
-------------
- rename pyart-mch to master-mch
- Change documentation to reflect that pull requests have to be done in specifically named branches. (You do not modify master)
- Complete docstrings in Pyrad to specify the user defined keywords each function accepts. Make sure default values and the input data types are specified in the documentation
