pyrad.io.TimeSeries
===================

.. currentmodule:: pyrad.io

.. autoclass:: TimeSeries

   

.. HACK -- the point here is that we don't want this to appear in the output, but the autosummary should still generate the pages.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree:


   ~TimeSeries.add_dataseries
   ~TimeSeries.add_timesample
   ~TimeSeries.plot
   ~TimeSeries.plot_hist
   ~TimeSeries.write
