SingleDop is a software module, written in the Python programming language, that will retrieve two-dimensional low-level winds from either real or simulated Doppler radar data. It mimics the functionality of the algorithm described in the following reference: Xu et al., 2006: Background error covariance functions for vector wind analyses using Doppler-radar radial-velocity observations. Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc., 132, 2887-2904. The interface is simplified to a single line of code in the end user's Python scripts, making implementation of the algorithm in their research analyses very easy. The software package also interfaces well with other open source radar packages, such as the Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART). Simple visualization (including vector and contour plots) and save/load routines (to preserve analysis results) are also provided.
