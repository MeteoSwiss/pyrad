libDx50: X-Band-Radar DX50 C-Library and Applications
=====================================================

1. Products of this library
---------------------------

libDX50.so : Library to be loaded by IDL to get data from the
             rainbow files.
             A list with functions that can be called from IDL
             is given by the h-file 'include/idl.h'.
	     All IDL callable function start with the prefix 'idl_'.

	     Example of an IDL call to this library:
             IDL> ok = call_external('libDX50.so', 'idl_printLibVersion')
             # Prints the version and date/time of the compilation.

psrReduce :  Application to reduce a DX50 power spectrum file (psr-file).
             Small power values are set to zero then the file is 
             compressed with simple method.

             Usage:
             bash> psrReduce <filename> [-t threshold][-o outputfilename]

	     -t <threshold>: Power values below this threshold are set to zero.
                             default: 2.0
             -o <name>     : Specify the filename of the output file
                             default <filename>.rd

psrUncompress : Decompress a reduced file.

             Usage:
             bash> psrUncompress <filename> [-o outfilename]

             -o <name> : Specifies the output file. Default is
                         to remove the '.rd' extension.

2. Building
-----------

From a bash:
# make               : Compile all
                       'libDX50.so' is created in the 'lib/' folder.
                       'psrReduce' and 'psrUncompress' are put to
                       the 'bin/' folder.

# make lib           : Just compile 'libDX50.so'
# make psr           . Compile 'psrReduce' and 'psrUncompress'
