TJL 7 August 2015 â€” Made code able to run under Python 2.7 or 3.4. Also applied pep8.

v1.1.0 18 June 2015 -- Oh gosh, where to begin?
    - Bugs in CAPE calculations: were mixing ambient temperature-derived 
      significant levels with virtual temperature formulation for CAPE, 
      which was producing some weird results in special cases
    - Fixed plotting and cape calculations for soundings that had a 
      tropopause above 100hPa
    - A few minor plotting issues
    - Responses to bugs raised by community

v1.0.1 Minor bug fix to suppress runtime warnings when P_lfc was nan
    
v1.0 10 October 2014 Major overhaul to implement new matplotlib 
transformations and CAPE routines.

    
v0.1.4r4 02 Sep 2014 --Fixed examples

v0.1.4r3 02 Sep 2014 --Fixed base of standard atmosphere.
    - It's now aware of the lowest pressure level. Changing the upper 
      pressure level still causes things to break horribly. 

v0.1.4r2 20 Feb 2014 --New diagnostics and minor plotting changes.

v0.1.4r1 20 Feb 2014 --New diagnostics and minor plotting changes.
    - Trying to get examples uploaded. 
    - fixed bug in readfile. Changed routine name to uwyofile

v0.1.4 20 Feb 2014 --New diagnostics and minor plotting changes.
    - Replaced "273.15" with thermodynamics.degCtoK
    - Added a precipitable water diagnostic on request from Doug Miller! 
      please feel free to request others, or even better, write your own.
    
v0.1.3r1 26 July -- Minor plotting changes and shell command-line features 
(No new release for pypi)
    - zorder of parcel plot set to plot beneath tc/td trace but above text 
      labels
    - shell command invocation: 
	- "python SkewT.py" does the two examples from the "examples" 
	  directory
	- "python SkewT.py example" does the same thing
	- "python SkewT.py path/to/soundingfile.txt" makes a skewt plot of 
	  the sounding in soundingfile, provided it confirms to the UWyo 
	  format
    
v0.1.3 25 July 2013 -- Minor changes (New release for pypi):
    - Fixed Masked Value error in add_profile (Thanks Simon). The routing 
      now enforces masked values so that an exception is not raised when 
      counting the number of barbs to draw [nbarbs=(~uu.mask).sum()]
    - Added an automated parcel routine. This works by analysing the lowest 
      few levels (kwarg mixheight in mbar) to give:
	- surface pressure (pressure of lowest level)
	- surface temperature [derived from max(theta)] in lowst levels
	- surface dew point [derived from mean(mixr)] in lowest levels
      This seems to give pretty good agreement with the parcels in the BOM 
      soundings, but I can't make it perfect. I presume they use a forecast 
      daily max T for the parcel instead of a mixed value. The ability to 
      define your own parcel is retained but plot_skewt() now automatically 
      plots a parcel.
    - Added a couple of routines to thermodynamics.py to enable this to 
      work. TempK now calculates temperature given theta and pressure (I 
      can't believe I didn't already have this)
    
v0.1.2 08 July 2013 -- A number of changes:
    - Added a parcel ascent routine based on provided pressure, dewpoint and 
      temperature. This routine adds some characteristics to the plot in the 
      upper LHS. TODO: initialise parcels automatically, calculate CAPE and 
      CIN and Precipitable water... 
    - Removed reliance on rcParams to make the figure look pretty. Did this 
      because I got annoyed (and I'm sure that others will too) at what 
      happens to graphs plotted subsequently... they end up with yellow axes 
      etc. 
    - Improved some of the aesthetics of the plot... moved standard 
      atmosphere height axis to right hand side.

v0.1.1 03 July 2013 -- Very minor changes to docs and figure plotting.

v0.1.0 01 July 2013 -- Initial Release!
